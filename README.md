langgraph-mem0-rag-template
===========================

template for langgraph agent with mem0 and rag (both native and graph rag) support

why?
----

~i have nothing to do so ill work on random things~

langgraph already provides a lot of templates to work with but none of them can be used as base for your future projects. 

to solve this problem, i have decided to make a fully customizable agent template.

what will it have?
------------------

- [ ] customizable llm model
- [ ] customizable embedding model
- [ ] customizable storage (vector)
- [ ] customizable graph storage
- [ ] langgraph studio/server support for making deployment easy
- [ ] will think of more things

once this is completed, work on building different types of agents (supervisor, etc)
